# Analytics engine - Hobbe 

## Objective
Developing an analytics engine that allow the creators of the app Hobbe solving four types of questions and  taking relaible decisions. 
  1. Design and develop the data data flow from the app to the analytics engine.
  2. Deploy the analytics engine on the web.


## Data
The data used in this project came from real time interactions of users with the app that were stored in firestore database and
from external sources that were stored on a github repository. In the case of the first one the structure of the database is as follows.

In the branch users it was stored the information of the users and their interactions with the app. The structure of the subbranch can be seen down below.

## Development 
The diagram down below show the data flow. First the data is stored in firestore, then it goes to big query where it will be modified from  key base format to tabular format and 
finally the data feeds a dashboard deployed on google Data Studio

The dashboard answers the next questions:

Type 1 - Telemetry 

When do the app have experienced the most crashes?
In which version the users have experienced the most crashes?
In which devices the users have experienced the most crashes?
In which operating systems the users have experienced the most crashes?
Which components of the app have produced the most crashes?
What is the distribution of Android OS and Apple OS versions using our application?
What is the distribution in regards to the type of request the users do?
What is the number of successful requests to the back-end services?


Type 2

Which are the activities on trending?
What is the trending category?
Which are the most economic activities?
Do we have activities attended to a certain times?
Which are the trending locations?
Which is the trending individual activity?

Which view of the app consumes the most memory?
Which type of error event consumes the most memory?
In which views the user spends the most time and therefore are more suitable to include advertisement?
