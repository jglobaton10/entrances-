# Predicting epileptic seizures using epileptic spikes characterization and EEG data 

# Objectives

The main objective of the project is to predict epileptic seizures using machine learning techniques from
EEG data that comes from the research done by the Children's Hospital Boston in
patients with epilepsy and the results obtained from the typification of epileptic spikes.
As well as analyzing the influence that have different types of epileptic spikes  
on the prediction of the seizures generated. 

  1. Defining variables that allow to characterize the epileptic spikes and later on cluster them.
  2. Typify the epileptic spikes using non supervised machine learning with the objective of enriching the EEG data that will be used on the predictive models
